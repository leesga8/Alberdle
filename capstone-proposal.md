# Project Proposal Template

## Name of Student: 

Albert Lee

## Name of Project:

Alberdle 

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 

Alberdle is a word-guessing game that users will play to find the correct word. It is based on the game Wordle, where a user has six chances to solve the word, given hints from the game.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

The MVP of the project will have the basic UI and layout of the game and basic functionality that will alow the user to play the game and win/lose. The basic UI includes, rows of letter boxes, three colored hints for each letter, and a responsive keyboard under the rows. The basic functionality of the game allows the user to input a word, determine which letters are correct in the word and ultimately win the game if the correct word is guessed or lose the game if they run out of chances. 

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.



## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
